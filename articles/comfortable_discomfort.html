        <h2>Comfortable Discomfort</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up, I was a notorious procrastinator who often left
          assignments until the very end and viewed studying as a purely
          optional exercise. Somehow, I was able to achieve slightly
          above-average grades throughout high school, which were thankfully
          enough for a university to give me a chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me be clear about one thing before I continue: the only reason I
          was able to achieve these grades was solely due to my environment. I
          was surrounded by intelligent, hardworking students in an accelerated
          math and science program, and in order to avoid being known as the
          "dumbest kid" in the class, they motivated me to put in more effort
          than I cared to. I was perfectly happy staying up until 3 AM playing
          video games and sleeping through my morning classes, but knowing that
          every other student in my program was getting 80s and 90s on every
          assignment, quiz, and test forced me to care just enough about my work
          to avoid this sort of embarrassment. If it weren't for my competitive
          nature and the students that surrounded me, I would've been fine with
          mediocre grades and likely never pursued university. For that, I am
          thankful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I started my journey as an undergraduate student, however, I
          slowly began to learn that the same habits weren't enough. I started
          failing certain classes, gained weight, began drinking and smoking
          regularly, and ultimately stopped caring about my life, let alone my
          studies. I suffered and was on a path to failure, but I refused to
          acknowledge my problems and continued to self-medicate in any way
          possible. The thought of becoming a college dropout made me
          uncomfortable, but instead of confronting this feeling and facing it
          with a rational solution, I cowered and retreated to unhealthy
          remedies—ones that gave me immediate comfort, a false sense of
          security.
        </p>
        <p>
          This lifestyle caused me to fall behind in my studies. I became
          dependent on alcohol, cannabis, and psychedelics to experience any
          glimpse of happiness and to avoid any sort of discomfort, especially
          the fear of failure. I isolated myself and created this false illusion
          that everything would be fine. I refused to change, which subsequently
          led to several mental breakdowns and eventually finding myself
          hospitalized at a psychiatric facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the darkest time of my life. The details of the experiences
          that followed are not important, but let me say this: I am truly
          grateful that I experienced it. At first, I viewed my hospitalization
          as another failure, but once I started to see it as an opportunity, my
          life changed for the better. It gave me a chance to reflect on my
          lifestyle, my choices, my dreams, my goals, and most importantly, my
          problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, after reflecting on my mistakes, I realized
          that I was a genuine coward. I realized that in the past, I would run
          from my problems and any sign of discomfort. It took me a long time to
          understand that discomfort is healthy for growth. It is an emotion
          that grounds you, and if given the opportunity, it allows you to
          observe reality in its truest nature, serving as man's greatest
          motivator.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a firm believer that happiness is an emotion perceived based on
          past experiences of opposing emotions. I truly believe that no human
          can experience an infinite, constant feeling of happiness throughout
          their lifetime and still deem they were truly happy by the end of it.
          How can you ever be happy if you've never once suffered? Sure, you may
          argue that in this hypothetical model, a man can experience a
          monotonic state of pleasure at every given point in their lifetime,
          but I would argue that this person is no longer human. But that is
          beside the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main points I'm trying to make here. Firstly, discomfort
          is unavoidable. At every stage in your life, you will be forced to
          endure uncomfortable experiences. There is no way to run. Running
          simply delays the consequences that will inevitably follow and leads
          you to live a false reality. For example, instead of studying in my
          first year of university, I decided to play video games, drink beer,
          smoke weed, or... the list goes on. I chose to avoid the slight
          discomfort of studying and assumed I'd be able to cram all the content
          at the end of the semester. This foolproof strategy of maximizing
          dopamine didn't pan out as well as I hoped, obviously. Secondly,
          discomfort gives you an opportunity to compare your current reality
          with the hypothetical reality in the case that you fail. This gives
          you time to reflect on the source of this discomfort and map out
          possible actions based on potential consequences. This is especially
          important because it serves as motivation to overcome the discomfort,
          and more often than not, there are rewards for overcoming these
          challenges. For example, if I were rational about my study habits, I'd
          know that I wouldn't be able to cram all my course content and would
          likely fail my courses. Knowing this, I'd realize that I'm better off
          studying every day and saving the fun stuff for the weekends. That
          way, I pass all my courses and never have to work at McDonald's again!
        </p>
        <p>
          While I make all this sound very easy, I assure you that it's not. I
          spent the majority of my life running, and for that, I suffered the
          consequences. It takes a special sort of mindset to be comfortable
          with discomfort. Clearly, the phrase sounds counterintuitive, but I
          truly believe it is another aspect of our lives we can train so it
          becomes second nature. If we can learn to shift our mindset when
          encountering discomfort and train this behavior repeatedly, then in
          the future, we are guaranteed to face uncomfortable situations
          rationally and react logically.

          There is a quote I really like from Viktor E. Frankl's "Man's Search
          for Meaning" that is analogous to this article, or at least similar in
          terms of the core concept. I'll leave it up to you to decide.

          a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice." ― Viktor E. Frankl
