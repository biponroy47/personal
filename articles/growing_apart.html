        <h2>Growing Apart</h2>
        <p>
          I've been spending a lot of time lately thinking about my friends and
          how they affect my life. Over the last couple of years, I’ve noticed
          certain friendships spreading further apart and others growing closer
          together. While I think this is completely natural and happens to
          everyone, the problem I’ve been facing is trying to recognize those
          friendships that should have grown apart but I refuse to let go.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not a fan of cliques, nor am I a fan of exclusive friend groups.
          I’d like to believe that we’re all simply human beings who want to
          laugh together, smile together, and share memories for years to come.
          Over the last few years, I’ve noticed friends joining different
          circles, becoming different people, and growing as human beings, which
          I fully support. It is only natural, and it takes courage to change,
          so I salute them. However, the consequence of this is that they tend
          to forget about their old friendships, including, in this context, my
          existence. I notice some of these friends joining new circles where I
          am no longer welcome, and if I'm being honest, it does hurt. Let me
          also state that it is not solely their fault. I've entered a new
          chapter of my life as well, so naturally, our lives have both become
          too complicated to maintain these old relationships. This is,
          unfortunately, a natural consequence of growing up, but I try my best
          not to burn bridges unless I have to.
        </p>

        <p>
          Frankly, this is holding me back from moving on, continuing to grow as
          a human being, and finding more friends with similar goals. While I
          try to nurture and revive old friendships, the truth is our lives have
          changed, and we’ve simply grown apart. There is no logical reason to
          treat the friendship the same way as before. I’ve refused to accept
          this truth in the past, but now I'm slowly learning how detrimental it
          was to my overall well-being.
        </p>

        <p>
          Humans are social animals by nature. We are biologically wired to form
          social connections, and these bonds are essential to our survival and
          happiness. The drawback of this trait is that we may rely on these
          social connections to provide a sense of security in our own lives.
          From a biological point of view, this may be the sole reason it’s so
          difficult to end a friendship. While I assure you it’s not that
          simple, I think it’s important we all take some time in our lives to
          re-evaluate our friendships and determine if they are worth
          maintaining.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps there are some friends who no longer share the same ambitions
          they once did. I’d say you’re better off letting go of them and
          focusing on finding new friends who align with your goals and share
          the same drive. Perhaps there exists a friend in your life who has
          become far too different from the person you once knew, and you can no
          longer relate to them. In this case, it would be easier to accept the
          new version of this person instead of trying to force them to revert
          back to who they once were. Perhaps both you and your old friend are
          busy with new priorities as you both begin to plant your roots in the
          world and navigate the harsh reality of adulthood. Then maybe you’d be
          better off seeing this as a sign of growth for both you and them,
          accepting that life is complicated, and wishing them the best of luck
          for the future.

          As I continue to grow older, I set new goals for myself and try to
          improve in every tangible aspect of my life. Whether that is my
          health, knowledge, career, or personality, I’m starting to see that
          some of my old friends no longer align with these goals. I have
          friends who continue to live with bad habits, while I, on the other
          hand, make conscious efforts to avoid them. I have friends who are
          more reserved and prefer to stick to the same crowd, while I want to
          explore, make new friends, and be more spontaneous. Your environment
          is a crucial factor when considering personal growth. You can only
          differ from the norm within the same environment so much before being
          seen as an outsider. So, I think it’s better to place yourself in an
          environment where you can be your complete self rather than letting
          your environment restrict you and force you to be someone you don’t
          want to be. Part of that process is choosing who you want to keep in
          your life and determining if this person will truly be a good friend
          to you now and in the future.

          Friends will come and go, so there’s no reason to hold onto the same
          ones forever. Learning to let go is a part of life and acknowledging
          that this process is healthy for all of us. Part of it is knowing that
          deep inside, you’ll always care for each other, but in a different way
          as time passes by. Part of it is accepting that both you and your
          friends are discovering new parts of yourselves, setting new goals,
          prioritizing new aspects of your lives, and shifting focus onto new
          things. The point I’m trying to make here is that it’s completely
          natural for friends to grow apart, and it’s often a good sign. Once
          you can accept this fact, you can learn to let go of the ones holding
          you back and focus on becoming the best version of yourself.
