        <h2>The Future of Neurotechnology</h2>
        <p>
          I recently saw a video on YouTube where a man plays AimLab, a popular
          FPS training game using the Neuralink. It's unbelieveable how well he
          performed, infintely better than any human with the finiest motor
          skills could perform, it's quite insane actually. Sadly, the video is
          fake, but it shows just how powerful neurotechnology could be in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Wall Street Journal however posted a video about Neuralink's first
          real patient subject using the device to play chess, completely
          hands-free using the brain implant. He uses the cursor using his mind
          and no additional devices to move the pieces and play the game. I
          believe this could be the next big thing if we can create a device
          that allows the average person to use their computers with no mouse or
          keyboard.

          I think humans are very inefficient when it comes to using technology.
          When it comes to keyboards and mice, we are slow and a lot of time is
          wasted with simple mechnical movements. The same goes for other mobile
          devices like our phones and tablets. If we could use our minds to
          command our devices using our mind, this transition time of typing
          characters, moving mice, clicking buttons, it can all be eliminated
          and work can be done so much faster. As a programmer, we could simply
          think of where we want our cursor to go instead of moving our mice, or
          using VIM key inputs, and find the exact location in our code we want
          to modify instantly.
        </p>

          I'm optimistic Neuralink is successful in their research and clinical
          trials. There are a lot of competitors out there but the applications
          of this technology is unmeasurable. Surely there are quite a few risks
          as well but that is a discussion for later. Think of how much easier
          life could be if we could just think of whatever is on our mind, and
          have our computers do the work for us instantly. This is only
          beginning. Maybe one day we'll every application on our phones built
          into the neuralink. I wonder...
